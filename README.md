# Team JCKCJ at the Qiskit Hackathon at World of Quantum 2022

## Summary
This lecture is developed during the Qiskit Hackathon at World of Quantum 2022. It is on the topic of Quantum Adiabatic Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

The main target audience is master's students with preliminary background in quantum computing. Attendees of this lecture should be familiar with the basic concepts of linear algebra, quantum Hamiltonian, quantum circuit and  optimization.

The organization of lecture materials is as follows: Concepts and theory will be presented as front lecture in PowerPoint format. A Jupyter notebook is made to supply with examples and small quiz problems for students to solve during the lecture, as well as homework problems for the student to complete after the lecture.

During the lecture, two screens will be opened in parallel, one on the left for the PowerPoint and the other on the right for the Jupyter notebook. The notebook will be filled with solutions to the examples and quiz problems step by step by the lecturer and provided to the students after the lecture.

## Lecture Plan
The lecture consists of a PowerPoint presentation and a Jupyter notebook. The lecturer will present the general theoretic concepts in the PowerPoint and then shows on the notebook how these concepts are applied in the max-cut problem. In the notebook are small tasks, which the students should try to solve during the lecture.
